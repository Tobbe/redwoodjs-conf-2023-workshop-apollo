## Introduction

Hello and welcome to the RedwoodJS Conf Apollo workshop! In this workshop, we will be exploring Apollo Client more deeply, covering more advanced usages of Apollo Client and it's cache. My goal is to get you more familiar with these tools to unlock the potential in your apps.

Each exercise in this workshop is contained in its own folder starting with a number (e.g. [01-component-fragments](./01-component-fragments/)). Each of these exercises is its own Redwood app. Once you've completed the [workshop setup](./00-setup/), each exercise can be started as a regular Redwood app.

1. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   yarn
   ```
2. Start the app
   ```sh
   yarn rw dev
   ```
