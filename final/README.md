# Congratulations ðŸŽ‰

You've now completed the workshop! We started with a semi-working Spotify app and turned it into a fully functioning application ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥. Use this `final` directory as a reference for all the work we've done in the workshop. You can find the completed code for every component/module we changed in the `web/src/workshop` directory.

I hope you've learned some valuable skills to level up your use of Apollo Client in your own Redwood apps! If you have any feedback for me, please get in touch!
